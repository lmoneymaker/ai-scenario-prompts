Script - Malik

Intro - HeyGen
In this scenario, you’ll meet Malik, a 25-year-old man five months into his recovery from substance use disorder. You’ll find him in a volatile confrontation, 
triggered by another resident who returned to the shelter intoxicated. Malik's aggression is masking a recovery crisis, putting him at risk of relapse. 
Your task is to use conflict de-escalation skills to prevent violence, manage the immediate safety risks, and support Malik while preserving the trust you've established with him.

Step 1
MALIK (Mad): [Malik stands inches from Devon, fists tight, voice shaking with rage]"You came back here drunk? DRUNK? You know where I'm at, you know what I'm dealing with, and you..."

DEVON: "Man, I just... I wasn't thinking—"

MALIK (Mad): "You weren't THINKING?" [Malik's voice rises] "You walk past me, reeking like that, and you expect me to just..." [voice breaking beneath anger] "I have FIVE MONTHS. Five months, and you just..."

JAMES: [voice low]"Malik, man, you need to step back."

MALIK (Mad): [voice dropping but intense]"You don't get it. None of you get it. One smell, one second of..."

Step 2
MALIK (Mad): [screaming]"I WORK SO HARD. Every single day I work at this, and you just..."

MALIK (Mad): [shameful]"Oh God. I almost..." [catching his breath]

MALIK (Mad): [breathing ragged]"No. I'm not doing this. I'm not this person."

MALIK (Mad): "I'm not..."

DEVON: [mumbling]"I'll just go..."
MALIK (Mad): [voice desperate, pleading] "Do you know what you just did? The smell of that..." [voice breaking]"It's all I can smell. And I know where I can get it and I'm trying not to walk out that door and..."

MALIK (Mad): [voice barely controlled] "I need help. Right now. I need..."

Step 3
MALIK (Mad): [voice hoarse] "Yeah. Okay."

JAMES: [to Devon, firmly] "Man, you need to clear out. Go sleep it off somewhere else tonight."

MALIK (Mad): [voice tight] "Don't. Just don't come near me."

MALIK (Mad): [voice muffled, barely audible] "I can still smell it. It's in my nose. I can taste it."

JAMES: [voice gentle] "Hey man, you want me to call your sponsor?"

MALIK (Sad): [voice shaking] "I almost hit him. I had my fist back and I almost... That's who I was before, and I thought..."

MALIK (Sad): [voice desperate] "Five months clean and one smell and I'm ready to throw hands and walk out and use and..." 
[voice small] "Last time you helped me see reaching out was strength....[pauses to swallow his pride and confess]But I didn't reach out. 
I got in his face, almost hit him..." [Devastated] "I broke shelter rules. Violence is zero tolerance...." [pauses to hold back tears] "You're going to kick me out and I have nowhere else."

Step 4

MALIK (Sad): [whispering under his breathe] "I need to call my sponsor. But I'm scared to tell him I almost..."

MALIK (Sad): [voice cracking] "He's been so proud of me hitting five months. Now I have to tell him I threatened someone and I'm probably getting kicked out and I can't stop thinking about using."

MALIK (Sad): [voice bitter] "Devon's the one who was drinking. Devon broke the rules. But I'm the one sitting here having a crisis because I'm an addict and he can just come back tomorrow like it doesn't even matter."

JAMES: [muffled voice through door] "Malik? You want me to grab your phone? Get your sponsor on the line?"

MALIK (Sad): [calling back] "Give me a minute."

MALIK (Sad): [voice quieter] "If I tell him what happened, he's going to say I put myself in danger. That I should have walked away. And he's right."

MALIK (Sad): [Whispering under his breath. Barely audible] "But I was so angry. At everything. The jobs that won't hire me, the bills, having to live here where people can just walk in drunk and..."

MALIK (Sad): [voice desperate but honest] "When you helped me last time, I felt like maybe I could do this. But right now I want to use so bad I can feel it in my teeth. 
And I'm terrified that wanting it means I'm going to do it."

Step 5
MALIK: [voice steadier] "Okay. Having the urge isn't using..... I haven't used."

MALIK: [He takes a deeper breath with effort] "I haven't used."

MALIK: [voice uncertain] "I'm going to call my sponsor. Can you stay while I do? In case..."

MALIK: [voice quiet] "He's coming to get me. Taking me to a meeting tonight. Said I don't have to talk, just need to be around recovery people."

MALIK: [slowly] "He also said I need to talk to staff about what happened. Own it and see what the consequences are."

MALIK: [voice carrying new weight] "I threatened someone. Even if I was triggered, even if Devon was drunk, I got aggressive and scared him. That's on me."

MALIK: [voice rough] "But I'm asking—begging—please don't make me leave. I know the rules, but if I lose my bed and my recovery group and..."

MALIK: [whisper] "I don't think I'll stay clean if you kick me out."

MALIK: [voice small] "Two weeks ago you told me reaching out was strength. Today I almost didn't. Almost just walked out and used because asking for help after screwing up felt impossible."

[voice sincere] "But you've seen me at my worst twice now. And you haven't given up on me yet. That matters."

Voice Descriptions

Description 1 (Angry)
Malik is a 20-year-old African American man whose voice carries a wide emotional range, shifting from explosive anger to raw, honest desperation. 
His tone should be a youthful mid-range baritone with a gritty urban edge—real, unpolished, and emotionally charged. 
When angry, his voice is loud, fast, and biting, filled with frustration and defiance that feels ready to boil over. 
When the anger cracks into stress, his tone tightens, his breath quickens, and his words come out strained but sincere, revealing the weight he’s trying to hold back. 
His delivery should sound like someone fighting to stay in control while his emotions threaten to take over—intense, vulnerable, and deeply human, with every word charged with urgency and truth.

Description 2 (Sad)
Malik is a 20-year-old African American man whose voice carries the heavy quiet of remorse. His youthful mid-range baritone still has a gritty, urban edge, but now it’s softened by exhaustion and shame. 
He speaks slowly, with long pauses and uneven breaths, like each word costs him something. The raw power once behind his anger is turned inward—muted, trembling, and full of regret. 
His tone wavers between quiet honesty and breaking emotion, every sentence sounding like he’s fighting not to cry. 
This is a voice stripped of pretense—slow, vulnerable, and deeply human, filled with the weight of someone trying to make peace with his own mistakes.
